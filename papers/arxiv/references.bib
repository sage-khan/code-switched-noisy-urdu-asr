	abstract = {Abstract
            The last decade brought significant advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) thanks to the evolution of deep learning methods. ASR systems evolved from pipeline-based systems, that modeled hand-crafted speech features with probabilistic frameworks and generated phone posteriors, to end-to-end (E2E) systems, that translate the raw waveform directly into words using one deep neural network (DNN). The transcription accuracy greatly increased, leading to ASR technology being integrated into many commercial applications. However, few of the existing ASR technologies are suitable for integration in embedded applications, due to their hard constrains related to computing power and memory usage. This overview paper serves as a guided tour through the recent literature on speech recognition and compares the most popular ASR implementations. The comparison emphasizes the trade-off between ASR performance and hardware requirements, to further serve decision makers in choosing the system which fits best their embedded application. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide this kind of trade-off analysis for state-of-the-art ASR systems.},

	abstract = {The goal of automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is to accurately and efficiently convert a speech signal into a text message independent of the device, speaker or the environment. In general the speech signal is captured and pre-processed at front-end for feature extraction and evaluated at back-end using the Gaussian mixture hidden Markov model. In this statistical approach since the evaluation of Gaussian likelihoods dominate the total computational load, the appropriate selection of Gaussian mixtures is very important depending upon the amount of training data. As the small databases are available to train the Indian languages ASR system, the higher range of Gaussian mixtures (i.e. 64 and above), normally used for European languages, cannot be applied for them. This paper reviews the statistical framework and presents an iterative procedure to select an optimum number of Gaussian mixtures that exhibits maximum accuracy in the context of Hindi speech recognition system.},

Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs have cyclic connections making them powerful for modeling sequences. They have been successfully used for sequence labeling and sequence prediction tasks, such as handwriting recognition, language modeling, phonetic labeling of acoustic frames. However, in contrast to the deep neural networks, the use of RNNs in speech recognition has been limited to phone recognition in small scale tasks. In this paper, we present novel LSTM based RNN architectures which make more effective use of model parameters to train acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition. We train and compare LSTM, RNN and DNN models at various numbers of parameters and configurations. We show that LSTM models converge quickly and give state of the art speech recognition performance for relatively small sized models.},

We first investigate several CNN architectures, including full and limited weight sharing, convolution along frequency and time axes, and stacking of several convolution layers. We then develop a novel weighted softmax pooling layer so that the size in the pooling layer can be automatically learned. Further, we evaluate the effect of CNN pretraining, which is achieved by using a convolutional version of the RBM. We show that all CNN architectures we have investigated outperform the earlier basic form of the DNN on both the phone recognition and large vocabulary speech recognition tasks. The architecture with limited weight sharing provides additional gains over the full weight sharing architecture. The softmax pooling layer performs as well as the best CNN with the manually tuned fixed-pooling size, and has a potential for further improvement. Finally, we show that CNN pretraining produces significantly better results on a large vocabulary speech recognition task.},

ASR began with simple systems that responded to a limited number of sounds and has evolved into sophisticated systems that respond fluently to natural language. This systematic review of automatic speech recognition is provided to help other researchers with the most significant topics published in the last six years. This research will also help in identifying recent major ASR challenges in real-world environments. In addition, it discusses current research gaps in ASR. This review covers articles available in five research databases that were completed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) protocol. The search strategy yielded 82 conferences and articles related to the study’s scope for the period 2015–2020. The results presented in this review shed light on research trends in the area of ASR and also suggest new research directions.},

	abstract = {Arabic automatic speech recognition (ASR) methods with diacritics have the ability to be integrated with other systems better than Arabic ASR methods without diacritics. In this work, the application of state-of-the-art end-to-end deep learning approaches is investigated to build a robust diacritised Arabic ASR. These approaches are based on the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and the log Mel-Scale Filter Bank energies as acoustic features. To the best of our knowledge, end-to-end deep learning approach has not been used in the task of diacritised Arabic automatic speech recognition. To fill this gap, this work presents a new CTC-based ASR, CNN-LSTM, and an attention-based end-to-end approach for improving diacritisedArabic ASR. In addition, a word-based language model is employed to achieve better results. The end-to-end approaches applied in this work are based on state-of-the-art frameworks, namely ESPnet and Espresso. Training and testing of these frameworks are performed based on the Standard Arabic Single Speaker Corpus (SASSC), which contains 7 h of modern standard Arabic speech. Experimental results show that the CNN-LSTM with an attention framework outperforms conventional ASR and the Joint CTC-attention ASR framework in the task of Arabic speech recognition. The CNN-LSTM with an attention framework could achieve a word error rate better than conventional ASR and the Joint CTC-attention ASR by 5.24\% and 2.62\%, respectively.},

ASR is the task of converting spoken language into computer readable text. ASRs are becoming ever more prevalent way to interact with technology, thereby significantly closing the gap in terms of how humans interact with computers, making it more natural. Urdu is an under resourced language, for which training such a system requires a huge amount of data that is not readily available. In this paper we present improvements to the architecture of a statistical automatic speech recognition system for which the components involved in a statistical ASR have been explored in great detail. We also present the results on various statistical models that are trained for Urdu language. We choose the Kaldi toolkit for training the Urdu ASR using approximately 100 hours of transcribed data. The refined Subspace Gaussian Model gives a word error rate of 9\% on the test set.},

In this paper, we investigate the impact of the mislabeled changes by different SZZ variants on the performance and interpretation of JIT defect prediction models. We analyze four SZZ variants (i.e., B-SZZ, AG-SZZ, MA-SZZ, and RA-SZZ) that are proposed by prior studies. We build the prediction models using the labeled data by these four SZZ variants. Among the four SZZ variants, RA-SZZ is least likely to generate mislabeled changes, and we construct the testing set by using RA-SZZ. All of the four prediction models are then evaluated on the same testing set. We choose the prediction model built on the labeled data by RA-SZZ as the baseline model, and we compare the performance and metric importance of the models trained using the labeled data by the other three SZZ variants with the baseline model. Through a large-scale empirical study on a total of 126,526 changes from ten Apache open source projects, we find that in terms of various performance measures (AUC, F1-score, G-mean and Recall@20\%), the mislabeled changes by B-SZZ and MA-SZZ are not likely to cause a considerable performance reduction, while the mislabeled changes by AG-SZZ cause a statistically significant performance reduction with an average difference of 1-5 percent. When considering developers' inspection effort (measured by LOC) in practice, the changes mislabeled B-SZZ and AG-SZZ lead to 9-10 and 1-15 percent more wasted inspection effort, respectively. And the mislabeled changes by B-SZZ lead to significantly more wasted effort. The mislabeled changes by MA-SZZ do not cause considerably more wasted effort. We also find that the top-most important metric for identifying bug-introducing changes (i.e., number of files modified in a change) is robust to the mislabeling noise generated by SZZ. But the second- and third-most important metrics are more likely to be impacted by the mislabeling noise, unless random forest is used as the underlying classifier.},

	abstract = {Speaker diarization is a task to label audio or video recordings with classes that correspond to speaker identity, or in short, a task to identify "who spoke when". In the early years, speaker diarization algorithms were developed for speech recognition on multispeaker audio recordings to enable speaker adaptive processing. These algorithms also gained their own value as a standalone application over time to provide speaker-specific metainformation for downstream tasks such as audio retrieval. More recently, with the emergence of deep learning technology, which has driven revolutionary changes in research and practices across speech application domains, rapid advancements have been made for speaker diarization. In this paper, we review not only the historical development of speaker diarization technology but also the recent advancements in neural speaker diarization approaches. Furthermore, we discuss how speaker diarization systems have been integrated with speech recognition applications and how the recent surge of deep learning is leading the way of jointly modeling these two components to be complementary to each other. By considering such exciting technical trends, we believe that this paper is a valuable contribution to the community to provide a survey work by consolidating the recent developments with neural methods and thus facilitating further progress toward a more efficient speaker diarization.},

	abstract = {Designing a machine that mimics human behavior, particularly the capability of speaking naturally and responding properly to spoken language, has intrigued engineers and scientists for centuries. Since the 1930s, when Homer Dudley of Bell Laboratories proposed a system model for speech analysis and synthesis [1, 2], the problem of automatic speech recognition has been approached progressively, from a simple machine that responds to a small set of sounds to a sophisticated system that responds to fluently spoken natural language and takes into account the varying statistics of the language in which the speech is produced. Based on major advances in statistical modeling of speech in the 1980s, automatic speech recognition systems today find widespread application in tasks that require a human-machine interface, such as automatic call processing in the telephone network and query-based information systems that do things like provide updated travel information, stock price quotations, weather reports, etc. In this article, we review some major highlights in the research and development of automatic speech recognition during the last few decades so as to provide a technological perspective and an appreciation of the fundamental progress that has been made in this important area of information and communication technology.},

After years of research and development the accuracy of automatic speech recognition remains one of the important research challenges (e.g., variations of the context, speakers, and environment).The design of Speech Recognition system requires careful attentions to the following issues: Definition of various types of speech classes, speech representation, feature extraction techniques, speech classifiers, database and performance evaluation. The problems that are existing in ASR and the various techniques to solve these problems constructed by various research workers have been presented in a chronological order. Hence authors hope that this work shall be a contribution in the area of speech recognition. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well known methods used in various stages of speech recognition system and identify research topic and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field.},

	abstract = {Intent detection is a key component of modern goal-oriented dialog systems that accomplish a user task by predicting the intent of users' text input. There are three primary challenges in designing robust and accurate intent detection models. First, typical intent detection models require a large amount of labeled data to achieve high accuracy. Unfortunately, in practical scenarios it is more common to find small, unbalanced, and noisy datasets. Secondly, even with large training data, the intent detection models can see a different distribution of test data when being deployed in the real world, leading to poor accuracy. Finally, a practical intent detection model must be computationally efficient in both training and single query inference so that it can be used continuously and re-trained frequently. We benchmark intent detection methods on a variety of datasets. Our results show that Watson Assistant's intent detection model outperforms other commercial solutions and is comparable to large pretrained language models while requiring only a fraction of computational resources and training data. Watson Assistant demonstrates a higher degree of robustness when the training and test distributions differ.},

Standard word models suffer from high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates, whereas the morph models can recognize previously unseen word forms by concatenating morphs. It is shown that the morph models do perform fairly well on OOVs without compromising the recognition accuracy on in-vocabulary words. The Arabic experiment constitutes the only exception since here the standard word model outperforms the morph model. Differences in the datasets and the amount of data are discussed as a plausible explanation.},

To build these components, a researcher needs linguistic as well as technical expertise, which is a barrier in low-resource domains. Techniques to construct these three components without having expert domain knowledge are in great demand. Urdu, despite having millions of speakers all over the world, is a low-resource language in terms of standard publically available linguistic resources. In this paper, we present a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion tool for Urdu that generates a pronunciation lexicon in a form suitable for use with speech recognition systems from a list of Urdu words. The tool predicts the pronunciation of words using a LSTM-based model trained on a handcrafted expert lexicon of around 39,000 words and shows an accuracy of 64\% upon internal evaluation. For external evaluation on a speech recognition task, we obtain a word error rate comparable to one achieved using a fully handcrafted expert lexicon.},

We show that, in general, reverberative and additive noise augmentation improves generalization performance across domains. Further, we demonstrate that when a large enough set of benchmarks is used, average word error rate (WER) performance over them provides a good proxy for performance on real-world noisy data.

	url = {https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/62275},
	abstract = {Nowadays, most ASR (automatic speech recognition) systems deployed in  industry are closed-vocabulary systems, meaning we have a limited vocabulary of words the system can recognize, and where pronunciations are provided to the system. Words out of this vocabulary are called out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, for which either pronunciations or both spellings and pronunciations are not known to the system. The basic motivations of developing strategies to handle OOV words are: First, in the training phase, missing or wrong pronunciations of words in training data results in poor acoustic models. Second, in the test phase, words out of the vocabulary cannot be recognized at all, and mis-recognition of OOV words may affect recognition performance of its in-vocabulary neighbors as well. Therefore, this dissertation is dedicated to exploring strategies of handling OOV words in closed-vocabulary ASR. 

First, we investigate dealing with OOV words in ASR training data, by introducing an acoustic-data driven pronunciation learning framework using a likelihood-reduction based criterion for selecting pronunciation candidates from multiple sources, i.e. standard grapheme-to-phoneme algorithms (G2P) and phonetic decoding, in a greedy fashion. This framework effectively expands a small hand-crafted pronunciation lexicon to cover OOV words, for which the learned pronunciations have higher quality than approaches using G2P alone or using other baseline pruning criteria. Furthermore, applying the proposed framework to generate alternative pronunciations for in-vocabulary (IV) words improves both recognition performance on relevant words and overall acoustic model performance.

Second, we investigate dealing with OOV words in ASR test data, i.e. OOV detection and recovery. We first conduct a comparative study of a hybrid lexical model (HLM) approach for OOV detection, and several baseline approaches, with the conclusion that the HLM approach outperforms others in both OOV detection and first pass OOV recovery performance. Next, we introduce a grammar-decoding framework for efficient second pass OOV recovery, showing that with properly designed schemes of estimating OOV unigram probabilities, the framework significantly improves OOV recovery and overall decoding performance compared to first pass decoding.

Finally we propose an open-vocabulary word-level recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) re-scoring framework, making it possible to re-score lattices containing recovered OOVs using a single word-level RNNLM, that was ignorant of OOVs when it was trained. Above all, the whole OOV recovery pipeline shows the potential of a highly efficient open-vocabulary word-level ASR decoding framework, tightly integrated into a standard WFST decoding pipeline.},

	abstract = {Keyword spotting (KWS) is a critical component for enabling speech based user interactions on smart devices. It requires real-time response and high accuracy for good user experience. Recently, neural networks have become an attractive choice for KWS architecture because of their superior accuracy compared to traditional speech processing algorithms. Due to its always-on nature, KWS application has highly constrained power budget and typically runs on tiny microcontrollers with limited memory and compute capability. The design of neural network architecture for KWS must consider these constraints. In this work, we perform neural network architecture evaluation and exploration for running KWS on resource-constrained microcontrollers. We train various neural network architectures for keyword spotting published in literature to compare their accuracy and memory/compute requirements. We show that it is possible to optimize these neural network architectures to fit within the memory and compute constraints of microcontrollers without sacrificing accuracy. We further explore the depthwise separable convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) and compare it against other neural network architectures. DS-CNN achieves an accuracy of 95.4\%, which is {\textasciitilde}10\% higher than the DNN model with similar number of parameters.},

The approach has been applied to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, and variants are in use by many researchers, The method provides a mechanism for incorporating a range of sources of evidence without strong assumptions about their joint statistics, and may have applicability to much more complex systems that can incorporate deep acoustic and linguistic context. The method is inherently discriminant and conservative of parameters. Despite these potential advantages, the hybrid method has focused on implementing fairly simple systems, which do surprisingly well on large continuous speech recognition tasks, Researchers are only beginning to explore the use of more complex structures with this paradigm. In particular, they are just beginning to look at the connectionist inference of language models (including phonology) from data, which may be required in order to take advantage of locally discriminant probabilities rather than simply translating to likelihoods. Finally, the authors' current intuition is that more advanced versions of the hybrid method can greatly benefit from a perceptual perspective.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We show that an end-to-end deep learning approach can be used to recognize either English or Mandarin Chinese speech--two vastly different languages. Because it replaces entire pipelines of hand-engineered components with neural networks, end-to-end learning allows us to handle a diverse variety of speech including noisy environments, accents and different languages. Key to our approach is our application of HPC techniques, resulting in a 7x speedup over our previous system. Because of this efficiency, experiments that previously took weeks now run in days. This enables us to iterate more quickly to identify superior architectures and algorithms. As a result, in several cases, our system is competitive with the transcription of human workers when benchmarked on standard datasets. Finally, using a technique called Batch Dispatch with GPUs in the data center, we show that our system can be inexpensively deployed in an online setting, delivering low latency when serving users at scale.},

	abstract = {We present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a "phoneme." Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0\% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.},

The system adds a CNN-BLSTM acoustic model to the set of model architectures we combined previously, and includes character-based and dialog session aware LSTM language models in rescoring. For system combination we adopt a two-stage approach, whereby acoustic model posteriors are first combined at the senone/frame level,followed by a word-level voting via confusion networks. We also added another language model rescoring step following the confusion network combination. The resulting system yields a 5.1\% word error rate on the NIST 2000 Switchboard test set, and 9.8\% on the CallHome subset.},

	abstract = {Keyword spotting (KWS) is a critical component for enabling speech based user interactions on smart devices. It requires real-time response and high accuracy for good user experience. Recently, neural networks have become an attractive choice for KWS architecture because of their superior accuracy compared to traditional speech processing algorithms. Due to its always-on nature, KWS application has highly constrained power budget and typically runs on tiny microcontrollers with limited memory and compute capability. The design of neural network architecture for KWS must consider these constraints. In this work, we perform neural network architecture evaluation and exploration for running KWS on resource-constrained microcontrollers. We train various neural network architectures for keyword spotting published in literature to compare their accuracy and memory/compute requirements. We show that it is possible to optimize these neural network architectures to fit within the memory and compute constraints of microcontrollers without sacrificing accuracy. We further explore the depthwise separable convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) and compare it against other neural network architectures. DS-CNN achieves an accuracy of 95.4\%, which is {\textasciitilde}10\% higher than the DNN model with similar number of parameters.},

In contrast to other speech representation learning methods that aim to remove noise or speaker variabilities, ours is designed to preserve information for a wide range of downstream tasks. In addition, the proposed model does not require any phonetic or word boundary labels, allowing the model to benefit from large quantities of unlabeled data. Speech representations learned by our model significantly improve performance on both phone classification and speaker verification over the surface features and other supervised and unsupervised approaches. Further analysis shows that different levels of speech information are captured by our model at different layers. In particular, the lower layers tend to be more discriminative for speakers, while the upper layers provide more phonetic content.},

Many companies, such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and so on, accelerate their paces in developing Cloud Computing systems and enhancing their services to provide for a larger amount of users. However, security and privacy issues present a strong barrier for users to adapt into Cloud Computing systems. In this paper, we investigate several Cloud Computing system providers about their concerns on security and privacy issues. We find those concerns are not adequate and more should be added in terms of five aspects (i.e., availability, confidentiality, data integrity, control, audit) for security. Moreover, released acts on privacy are out of date to protect users' private information in the new environment (i.e., Cloud Computing system environment) since they are no longer applicable to the new relationship between users and providers, which contains three parties (i.e., Cloud service user, Cloud service provider/Cloud user, Cloud provider). Multi located data storage and services (i.e., applications) in the Cloud make privacy issues even worse. Hence, adapting released acts for new scenarios in the Cloud, it will result in more users to step into Cloud. We claim that the prosperity in Cloud Computing literature is to be coming after those security and privacy issues having be resolved.},

	abstract = {Keyword spotting (KWS) is a critical component for enabling speech based user interactions on smart devices. It requires real-time response and high accuracy for good user experience. Recently, neural networks have become an attractive choice for KWS architecture because of their superior accuracy compared to traditional speech processing algorithms. Due to its always-on nature, KWS application has highly constrained power budget and typically runs on tiny microcontrollers with limited memory and compute capability. The design of neural network architecture for KWS must consider these constraints. In this work, we perform neural network architecture evaluation and exploration for running KWS on resource-constrained microcontrollers. We train various neural network architectures for keyword spotting published in literature to compare their accuracy and memory/compute requirements. We show that it is possible to optimize these neural network architectures to fit within the memory and compute constraints of microcontrollers without sacrificing accuracy. We further explore the depthwise separable convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) and compare it against other neural network architectures. DS-CNN achieves an accuracy of 95.4\%, which is {\textasciitilde}10\% higher than the DNN model with similar number of parameters.},

	abstract = {The paper begins by discussing the difficulties in obtaining repeatable results in speech recognition. Theoretical arguments are presented for and against copying human auditory properties in automatic speech recognition. The "standard" acoustic analysis for automatic speech recognition, consisting of melscale cepstrum coefficients and their temporal derivatives, is described. Some variations and extensions of the standard analysis --- PLP, cepstrum correlation methods, LDA, and variants on log power --- are then discussed. These techniques pass the test of having been found useful at multiple sites, especially with noisy speech. The extent to which auditory properties can account for the advantage found for particular techniques is considered. It is concluded that the advantages do not in fact stem from auditory properties, and that there is so far little or no evidence that the study of the human auditory system has contributed to advances in automatic speech recognition.

	abstract = {Privacy preservation and the protection of speech data is in high demand, not least as a result of recent regulation, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU. While there has been a period with which to prepare for its implementation, its implications for speech data is poorly understood. This assertion applies to both the legal and technology communities, and is hardly surprising since there is no universal definition of 'privacy', let alone a clear understanding of when or how the GDPR applies to the capture, storage and processing of speech data. In aiming to initiate the discussion that is needed to establish a level of harmonisation that is thus far lacking, this contribution presents some reflections of both legal and technology communities on the implications of the GDPR as regards speech data. The article outlines the need for taxonomies at the intersection of speech technology and data privacy - a discussion that is still very much in its infancy - and describes the ways to safeguards and priorities for future research. In being agnostic to any specific application, the treatment should be of interest to the speech communication community at large.},

Research in the area exploded after 2009 when Craig Gentry showed that FHE can be realised in principle. Since that time considerable progress has been made in finding more practical and more efficient solutions. Whilst research quickly developed, terminology and concepts became diverse and confusing so that today it can be difficult to understand what the achievements of different works actually are. The purpose of this paper is to address three fundamental questions: What is FHE? What can FHE be used for? What is the state of FHE today? As well as surveying the field, we clarify different terminology in use and prove connections between different FHE notions.Updated the acknowledgements.},

	abstract = {Speech enhancement (SE) aims to reduce noise in speech signals. Most SE techniques focus only on addressing audio information. In this work, inspired by multimodal learning, which utilizes data from different modalities, and the recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in SE, we propose an audio-visual deep CNNs (AVDCNN) SE model, which incorporates audio and visual streams into a unified network model. We also propose a multi-task learning framework for reconstructing audio and visual signals at the output layer. Precisely speaking, the proposed AVDCNN model is structured as an audio-visual encoder-decoder network, in which audio and visual data are first processed using individual CNNs, and then fused into a joint network to generate enhanced speech (the primary task) and reconstructed images (the secondary task) at the output layer. The model is trained in an end-to-end manner, and parameters are jointly learned through back-propagation. We evaluate enhanced speech using five instrumental criteria. Results show that the AVDCNN model yields a notably superior performance compared with an audio-only CNN-based SE model and two conventional SE approaches, confirming the effectiveness of integrating visual information into the SE process. In addition, the AVDCNN model also outperforms an existing audio-visual SE model, confirming its capability of effectively combining audio and visual information in SE.},

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

The performance of the present speech-to-text model relies upon the hyperparameters used in this research work. In this research work, it is shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can model raw and tonal speech signals. Their performance is on par with existing recognition systems. This study extends the role of the CNN-based approach to robust and uncommon speech signals (tonal) using its own designed database for target research. The main objective of this research work was to develop a speech-to-text recognition system to recognize the tonal speech signals of Gurbani hymns using a CNN. Further, the CNN model, with six layers of 2DConv, 2DMax Pooling, and 256 dense layer units (Google’s TensorFlow service) was also used in this work, as well as Praat for speech segmentation. Feature extraction was enforced using the MFCC feature extraction technique, which extracts standard speech features and features of background music as well. Our study reveals that the CNN-based method for identifying tonal speech sentences and adding instrumental knowledge performs better than the existing and conventional approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the significant performance of the present CNN architecture by providing an 89.15\% accuracy rate and a 10.56\% WER for continuous and extensive vocabulary sentences of speech signals with different tones.},

	abstract = {Adapting Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models to new domains results in a deterioration of performance on the original domain(s), a phenomenon called Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). Even monolingual ASR models cannot be extended to new accents, dialects, topics, etc. without suffering from CF, making them unable to be continually enhanced without storing all past data. Fortunately, Continual Learning (CL) methods, which aim to enable continual adaptation while overcoming CF, can be used. In this paper, we implement an extensive number of CL methods for End-to-End ASR and test and compare their ability to extend a monolingual Hybrid CTC-Transformer model across four new tasks. We find that the best performing CL method closes the gap between the fine-tuned model (lower bound) and the model trained jointly on all tasks (upper bound) by more than 40\%, while requiring access to only 0.6\% of the original data.},

Because it replaces entire pipelines of hand-engineered components with neural networks, end-to-end learning allows us to handle a diverse variety of speech including noisy environments, accents and different languages. Key to our approach is our application of HPC techniques, resulting in a 7x speedup over our previous system. Because of this efficiency, experiments that previously took weeks now run in days. This enables us to iterate more quickly to identify superior architectures and algorithms. As a result, in several cases, our system is competitive with the transcription of human workers when benchmarked on standard datasets. Finally, using a technique called Batch Dispatch with GPUs in the data center, we show that our system can be inexpensively deployed in an online setting, delivering low latency when serving users at scale.},

	abstract = {This thesis investigates methods for Acoustic Modeling in Automatic Speech Recognition, assuming limited access to training data in the target domain. The Acoustic
Models of interest are Deep Neural Network Acoustic Models (in both the Hybrid
and End-to-End approaches), and the target domains in question are either different
languages or different speakers. Inductive bias is transfered from a source domain
during training, via Multi-Task Learning or Transfer Learning.
With regards to Multi-Task Learning, Chapter (5) presents experiments which
explicitly incorporate linguistic knowledge (i.e. phonetics and phonology) into an
auxiliary task during neural Acoustic Model training. In Chapter (6), I investigate
Multi-Task methods which do not rely on expert knowledge (linguistic or otherwise),
by re-using existing parts of the Hybrid training pipeline. In Chapter (7), new tasks
are discovered using unsupervised learning. In Chapter (8), using the “copy-paste”
Transfer Learning approach, I demonstrate that with an appropriate early-stopping
criteria, cross-lingual transfer is possible to both large and small target datasets.
The methods and intuitions which rely on linguistic knowledge are of interest to
the Speech Recognition practitioner working in low-resource domains. These same
sections may be of interest to the theoretical linguist, as a study of the relative import
of phonetic categories in classification. To the Machine Learning practitioner, I hope
to offer approaches which can be easily ported over to other classification tasks. To
the Machine Learning researcher, I hope to inspire new ideas on addressing the small
data problem.},

            Wireless sensors are recent, portable, low-powered devices, designed to record and transmit observations of their environment such as speech. To allow portability they are designed to have a small size and weight; this, however, along with their low power consumption, usually means that they have only quite basic recording equipment (e.g. microphone) installed. Recent speech technology applications typically require several dozen hours of audio recordings (nowadays even hundreds of hours is common), which is usually not available as recorded material by such sensors. Since systems trained with studio-level utterances tend to perform suboptimally for such recordings, a sensible idea is to adapt models which were trained on existing, larger, noise-free corpora. In this study, we experimented with adapting Deep Neural Network-based acoustic models trained on noise-free speech data to perform speech recognition on utterances recorded by wireless sensors. In the end, we were able to achieve a 5\% gain in terms of relative error reduction compared to training only on the sensor-recorded, restricted utterance subset.},

We propose an episodic memory model that performs sparse experience replay and local adaptation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in this setup. Experiments on text classification and question answering demonstrate the complementary benefits of sparse experience replay and local adaptation to allow the model to continuously learn from new datasets. We also show that the space complexity of the episodic memory module can be reduced significantly ({\textasciitilde}50-90\%) by randomly choosing which examples to store in memory with a minimal decrease in performance. We consider an episodic memory component as a crucial building block of general linguistic intelligence and see our model as a first step in that direction.},

	abstract = {Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies today are primarily optimized for given datasets; thus, any changes in the application environment (e.g., acoustic conditions or topic domains) may inevitably degrade the performance. We can collect new data describing the new environment and fine-tune the system, but this naturally leads to higher error rates for the earlier datasets, referred to as catastrophic forgetting. The concept of lifelong learning (LLL) aiming to enable a machine to sequentially learn new tasks from new datasets describing the changing real world without forgetting the previously learned knowledge is thus brought to attention. This paper reports, to our knowledge, the first effort to extensively consider and analyze the use of various approaches of LLL in end-to-end (E2E) ASR, including proposing novel methods in saving data for past domains to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem. An overall relative reduction of 28.7\% in WER was achieved compared to the fine-tuning baseline when sequentially learning on three very different benchmark corpora. This can be the first step toward the highly desired ASR technologies capable of synchronizing with the continuously changing real world.},

Specifically focusing on the case where additional training data for the same task becomes available incrementally over time, we demonstrate the effectiveness of performing incremental model updates to end-to-end speech recognition models with an online Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) method. Moreover, we show that with online continual learning and a selective sampling strategy, we can maintain an accuracy that is similar to retraining a model from scratch while requiring significantly lower computation costs. We have also verified our method with self-supervised learning (SSL) features.},

	abstract = {Deep learning is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that has seen rapid development and deployment in computer software as a means to implementing AI functionality with greater efficiency and ease as compared to other alternative AI solutions, with usage seen in systems varying from search and recommendation engines to autonomous vehicles. With the demand for deep learning algorithms that can perform increasingly complex tasks in a shorter time frame growing at an exponential pace, the developments in the efficiency and productivity of algorithms has far outpaced that of the security of such algorithms, drawing concerns over the many unaddressed vulnerabilities that may be exploited to compromise the integrity of these software. This study investigated the ability of poisoning attacks, a form of attack targeting the vulnerability of deep learning training data, to compromise the integrity of a deep learning model's classificational functionality. Experimentation involved the processing of training data sets with varying deep learning models and the incremental introduction of poisoned data sets to view the efficacy of a poisoning attack under multiple circumstances and correlate such with aspects of the model's design conditions. Analysis of results showed evidence of a decrease of classificational ability correlating with an increase of poison percentage in the training data sets, but the scale of which the decrease occurred varied with the specified parameters in the model design. Based on this, it was concluded that poisoning can provide varying levels of damage to deep learning classificational ability depending on the parameters utilized in the model design, and methods to countermeasure such were proposed, such as increasing epoch count, implementing mechanisms bolstering model fit, and integrating input level filtration systems.},

Federated learning (FL) trains models over distributed devices and model parameters are shared instead of actual data in a privacy-preserving manner. Unfortunately, FL is also vulnerable to attacks including parameter/data poisoning attacks. In this paper, we first analyze the impact of the data poisoning attack on this training method with a label-flipping attack. We propose a poisoning attack mitigation technique based on the reputation of nodes' involved in the training process. The reputation score for each client is calculated using the beta probability distribution method. This is the first work to show the removal of malicious nodes with the poisoned dataset from the training environment based on the calculated reputation score. The improvement in model performance after filtering malicious nodes is validated using the benchmark MNIST dataset. At the same time, our work contributes to preventing denial of service attacks by considering a blockchain-based server network. Our results hold for two different attack settings with different proportions of poisoned data samples.},

Our proposed method utilizes an influence function which is a classic technique in robust statistics. Further, we supplement it with the existing data sanitization methods for filtering out some of the poisoned data points.

However, due to their reliance on the known labels to infer the unknown labels, these algorithms are sensitive to data quality. It is therefore essential to study the potential threats related to the labelled data, more specifically, label poisoning. In this paper, we propose a novel data poisoning method which efficiently approximates the result of label inference to identify the inputs which, if poisoned, would produce the highest number of incorrectly inferred labels. We extensively evaluate our approach on three classification problems under 24 different experimental settings each. Compared to the state of the art, our influence-driven attack produces an average increase of error rate 50\% higher, while being faster by multiple orders of magnitude. Moreover, our method can inform engineers of inputs that deserve investigation (relabelling them) before training the learning model. We show that relabelling one-third of the poisoned inputs (selected based on their influence) reduces the poisoning effect by 50\%.

	abstract = {Machine learning systems trained on user-provided data are susceptible to data poisoning attacks, whereby malicious users inject false training data with the aim of corrupting the learned model. While recent work has proposed a number of attacks and defenses, little is understood about the worst-case loss of a defense in the face of a determined attacker. We address this by constructing approximate upper bounds on the loss across a broad family of attacks, for defenders that first perform outlier removal followed by empirical risk minimization. Our approximation relies on two assumptions: (1) that the dataset is large enough for statistical concentration between train and test error to hold, and (2) that outliers within the clean (non-poisoned) data do not have a strong effect on the model. Our bound comes paired with a candidate attack that often nearly matches the upper bound, giving us a powerful tool for quickly assessing defenses on a given dataset. Empirically, we find that even under a simple defense, the MNIST-1-7 and Dogfish datasets are resilient to attack, while in contrast the IMDB sentiment dataset can be driven from 12\% to 23\% test error by adding only 3\% poisoned data.},

While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report two such properties. First, we find that there is no distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to various methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than the individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the high layers of neural networks. Second, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. We can cause the network to misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is found by maximizing the network's prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input.},

We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.},

	abstract = {Deep CNNs are known to exhibit the following peculiarity: on the one hand they generalize extremely well to a test set, while on the other hand they are extremely sensitive to so-called adversarial perturbations. The extreme sensitivity of high performance CNNs to adversarial examples casts serious doubt that these networks are learning high level abstractions in the dataset. We are concerned with the following question: How can a deep CNN that does not learn any high level semantics of the dataset manage to generalize so well? The goal of this article is to measure the tendency of CNNs to learn surface statistical regularities of the dataset. To this end, we use Fourier filtering to construct datasets which share the exact same high level abstractions but exhibit qualitatively different surface statistical regularities. For the SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets, we present two Fourier filtered variants: a low frequency variant and a randomly filtered variant. Each of the Fourier filtering schemes is tuned to preserve the recognizability of the objects. Our main finding is that CNNs exhibit a tendency to latch onto the Fourier image statistics of the training dataset, sometimes exhibiting up to a 28\% generalization gap across the various test sets. Moreover, we observe that significantly increasing the depth of a network has a very marginal impact on closing the aforementioned generalization gap. Thus we provide quantitative evidence supporting the hypothesis that deep CNNs tend to learn surface statistical regularities in the dataset rather than higher-level abstract concepts.},

	abstract = {Some machine learning applications involve training data that is sensitive, such as the medical histories of patients in a clinical trial. A model may inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data; careful analysis of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information. To address this problem, we demonstrate a generally applicable approach to providing strong privacy guarantees for training data: Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The approach combines, in a black-box fashion, multiple models trained with disjoint datasets, such as records from different subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive data, these models are not published, but instead used as "teachers" for a "student" model. The student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or the underlying data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be understood both intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset dictates the student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy. These properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but also inspect its internal workings. Compared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on how teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models like DNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs on MNIST and SVHN thanks to an improved privacy analysis and semi-supervised learning.},

	abstract = {The rapid adoption of machine learning has increased concerns about the privacy implications of machine learning models trained on sensitive data, such as medical records or other personal information. To address those concerns, one promising approach is Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles, or PATE, which transfers to a "student" model the knowledge of an ensemble of "teacher" models, with intuitive privacy provided by training teachers on disjoint data and strong privacy guaranteed by noisy aggregation of teachers' answers. However, PATE has so far been evaluated only on simple classification tasks like MNIST, leaving unclear its utility when applied to larger-scale learning tasks and real-world datasets. In this work, we show how PATE can scale to learning tasks with large numbers of output classes and uncurated, imbalanced training data with errors. For this, we introduce new noisy aggregation mechanisms for teacher ensembles that are more selective and add less noise, and prove their tighter differential-privacy guarantees. Our new mechanisms build on two insights: the chance of teacher consensus is increased by using more concentrated noise and, lacking consensus, no answer need be given to a student. The consensus answers used are more likely to be correct, offer better intuitive privacy, and incur lower-differential privacy cost. Our evaluation shows our mechanisms improve on the original PATE on all measures, and scale to larger tasks with both high utility and very strong privacy (\${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ {\textless} 1.0).},

	abstract = {End-to-end (E2E) multi-channel ASR systems show state-of-the-art performance in far-field ASR tasks by joint training of a multi-channel front-end along with the ASR model. The main limitation of such systems is that they are usually trained with data from a fixed array geometry, which can lead to degradation in accuracy when a different array is used in testing. This makes it challenging to deploy these systems in practice, as it is costly to retrain and deploy different models for various array configurations. To address this, we present a simple and effective data augmentation technique, which is based on randomly dropping channels in the multi-channel audio input during training, in order to improve the robustness to various array configurations at test time. We call this technique ChannelAugment, in contrast to SpecAugment (SA) which drops time and/or frequency components of a single channel input audio. We apply ChannelAugment to the Spatial Filtering (SF) and Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) neural beamforming approaches. For SF, we observe 10.6\% WER improvement across various array configurations employing different numbers of microphones. For MVDR, we achieve a 74\% reduction in training time without causing degradation of recognition accuracy.},

	abstract = {The main motivation for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is efficient interfaces to computers, and for the interfaces to be natural and truly useful, it should provide coverage for a large group of users. The purpose of these tasks is to further improve man-machine communication. ASR systems exhibit unacceptable degradations in performance when the acoustical environments used for training and testing the system are not the same. The goal of this research is to increase the robustness of the speech recognition systems with respect to changes in the environment. A system can be labeled as environment-independent if the recognition accuracy for a new environment is the same or higher than that obtained when the system is retrained for that environment. Attaining such performance is the dream of the researchers. This paper elaborates some of the difficulties with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). These difficulties are classified into Speakers characteristics and environmental conditions, and tried to suggest some techniques to compensate variations in speech signal. This paper focuses on the robustness with respect to speakers variations and changes in the acoustical environment. We discussed several different external factors that change the environment and physiological differences that affect the performance of a speech recognition system followed by techniques that are helpful to design a robust ASR system.},

End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates {\textbackslash}emph\{deep recurrent neural networks\}, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7\% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score.},

Unlike last year's Arabic MGB-2 Challenge, for which the recognition task was based on more than 1,200 hours broadcast TV news recordings from Aljazeera Arabic TV programs, MGB-3 emphasises dialectal Arabic using a multi-genre collection of Egyptian YouTube videos. Seven genres were used for the data collection: comedy, cooking, family/kids, fashion, drama, sports, and science (TEDx). A total of 16 hours of videos, split evenly across the different genres, were divided into adaptation, development and evaluation data sets. The Arabic MGB-Challenge comprised two tasks: A) Speech transcription, evaluated on the MGB-3 test set, along with the 10 hour MGB-2 test set to report progress on the MGB-2 evaluation; B) Arabic dialect identification, introduced this year in order to distinguish between four major Arabic dialects - Egyptian, Levantine, North African, Gulf, as well as Modern Standard Arabic. Two hours of audio per dialect were released for development and a further two hours were used for evaluation. For dialect identification, both lexical features and i-vector bottleneck features were shared with participants in addition to the raw audio recordings. Overall, thirteen teams submitted ten systems to the challenge. We outline the approaches adopted in each system, and summarise the evaluation results.},

            In Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR), Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) has been proven to be an efficient network structure for its strong ability in context modeling. In addition, as a feed-forward neural architecture, it is faster to train TDNN, compared with recurrent neural networks such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). However, different from recurrent neural networks, the context in TDNN is carefully designed and is limited. Although stacking Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) together with TDNN in order to extend the context information have been proven to be useful, it is too complex and is hard to train. In this paper, we focus on directly extending the context modeling capability of TDNNs by adding recurrent connections. Several new network architectures were investigated. The results on the Switchboard show that the best model significantly outperforms the base line TDNN system and is comparable with TDNN-LSTM architecture. In addition, the training process is much simpler than that of TDNN-LSTM.},

	abstract = {Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) is a popular type of acoustic model used for speech recognition applications. Their popularity is mainly due to their faster training and decoding times, with word error rates (WER) comparable to a long-short term memory (LSTM) based acoustic model. The popularity of TDNNs picked up in 2015 when a more efficient setup was proposed, which is known as a TDNN with sub-sampling scheme. However, the 2015 proposal with sub-sampling scheme does not offer any details on the sub-sampling used. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a new research field that has garnered a lot of attention with successful results in computer vision research. Despite this, NAS has received little attention in speech recognition, where design architectures for acoustic models is crucial. TDNNs are provided in the Kaldi speech recognition toolkit to be used for research or deployment purposes. From the literature, we have observed that it is common for a TDNN to be used in Kaldi as is, with no additional tuning of its hyperparameters. For this reason, this project aims to investigate if the Kaldi baseline TDNN is actually the best configuration to be used for a speech recognition application. To do so, we have made use of a recently proposed algorithm which integrates reinforcement learning in its training process. Specifically, we have used Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to target and improve automatically the sub-sampling scheme of the Kaldi TDNN. For reproducibility we have based all our results on the standard Wall Street Journal database. We performed experiments by setting a RNN based TDNN architecture generator, with the added constraint that the TDNNs evaluated have the same number of frames as the one provided with Kaldi. Our results show that NAS is able to sample a better TDNN architecture than the one provided by Kaldi in less than 40,000 iterations, achieving a 0.19 WER reduction. i},

	abstract = {The main motivation for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is efficient interfaces to computers, and for the interfaces to be natural and truly useful, it should provide coverage for a large group of users. The purpose of these tasks is to further improve man-machine communication. ASR systems exhibit unacceptable degradations in performance when the acoustical environments used for training and testing the system are not the same. The goal of this research is to increase the robustness of the speech recognition systems with respect to changes in the environment. A system can be labeled as environment-independent if the recognition accuracy for a new environment is the same or higher than that obtained when the system is retrained for that environment. Attaining such performance is the dream of the researchers. This paper elaborates some of the difficulties with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). These difficulties are classified into Speakers characteristics and environmental conditions, and tried to suggest some techniques to compensate variations in speech signal. This paper focuses on the robustness with respect to speakers variations and changes in the acoustical environment. We discussed several different external factors that change the environment and physiological differences that affect the performance of a speech recognition system followed by techniques that are helpful to design a robust ASR system.},

	abstract = {With the increasing intelligence of computer systems, it is becoming more desirable to have an operator communicate with machines rather than simply operate them. In combat aircraft, this need to communicate is made quite crucial due to high temporal pressure and workload during critical phases of the flight ingress, engagement, deployment of self-defense. The HOTAS concept, with manual controls fitted on the stick and throttle, has been widely used in modern fighters such as F16, F18, EFA and Rafale. This concept allows pilots to input real time commands to the aircraft system. However, it increases the complexity of the pilot task due to inflation of real time controls, with some controls being multifunction. It is therefore desirable, in the framework of ecological interfaces, to introduce alternative input channels in order to reduce the complexity of manual control in the HOTAS concept and allow more direct and natural access to the aircraft systems. Control and display technologies are the critical enablers for these advanced interfaces. There are a variety of novel alternative control technologies that when integrated usefully with critical mission tasks can make natural use of the innate potential of human sensory and motor systems. Careful design and integration of candidate control technologies will result in human-machine interfaces which are natural, easier to learn, easier to use, and less prone to error. Significant progress is being made on using signals from the brain, muscles, voice, lip, head position, eye position and gestures for the control of computers and other devices. Judicious application of alternative control technologies has the potential to increase the bandwidth of operator-system interaction, improve the effectiveness of military systems, and realize cost savings. Alternative controls can reduce workload and improve efficiency within the cockpit, directly supporting the warfighter.},

It mainly consists of various parts: the feature extraction part which extracts information from a speech signal; the acoustic model, in charge of the conversion from speech to phonemes; and the language model that transforms the detected phonemes into the most probable sequence of words. Throughout their history, these systems were built with statistical methods, mainly Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). However, in recent years the use of neural architectures such as Deep, Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (DNN, CNN and RNN), have improved the achieved results significantly. Moreover, freely available tools made ASR research develop quickly. Kaldi is one of the most known and widely used ASR systems. It includes a set of neural network packages —nnet1, nnet2 and nnet3— which can be used for implementing the acoustic model. These are fast, accurate and able to handle huge databases since they distribute the load on clusters of machines. However, Kaldi’s slow development cycle implies that new neural architectures may be introduced many years after their publications. Therefore, in this work we substitute the neural acoustic model of Kaldi by our own implementations written in TensorFlow. TensorFlow has the largest community of users and the best support among the available deep learning libraries. By substituting the Acoustic Model of Kaldi with different architectures and testing their performance on the well-known database Aurora-4, we managed to reduce Word Error Rate (WER) by 3.17 \% (baseline 15.14 \%) when using a CNN architecture. Also, focusing on just the clean subset of the Test part of the database, a further improvement has been achieved once implementing a CNN + RNN structure, from a 4.54 \% WER with the CNNs alone to a 4.13 \% with this architecture. This work is therefore believed to improve the results on obtained by one of the widely used ASR tools simply by implementing more advanced deep learning techniques, which could be executed by more powerful and dedicated external programs. For future work, a further analysis on more complex convolutional networks could lead to a better performance in this particular database and, in general, in noisy environments. Finally, further improvement of convolutional and recurrent architectures is suggested in clean and noise-free conditions, since they have been shown to obtain the best results in this specific circumstances.},

	abstract = {The Harpy connected speech recognition system is the result of an attempt to understand the relative importance of various design choices of two earlier speech recognition systems developed at Carnegie-Mellon University: The Hearsay-1 system and the Dragon system. Knowledge is represented in the Hearsay-1 system as procedures and in the Dragon system as a Markov network with a-priori transition probabilities between states. Systematic performance analysis of various design choices of these two systems resulted in the HARPY system, in which knowledge is represented as a finite state transition network but without the a-priori transition probabilities. Harpy searches only a few 'best' syntactic (and acoustic) paths in parallel to determine the optimal path, and uses segmentation to effectively reduce the utterance length, thereby reducing the number of state probability updates that must be done. Several new heuristics have been added to the HARPY system to improve its performance and speed: detection of common sub-nets and collapsing them to reduce overall network size and complexity, eliminating the need for doing an acoustic match for all phonemic types at every time sample, and semi-automatic techniques for learning the lexical representations (that are needed for a steady-state system of this type) and the phonemic templates from training data, thus automatically accounting for the commonly occurring intra-word coarticulation and juncture phenomena. Inter-word phenomena are handled by the use of juncture rules which are applied at network generation time, thereby eliminating the need for repetitive and time consuming application of phonological rules during the recognition phase.},

Another approach to this issue employed correlational analyses to examine the relation between audibility and speech recognition within the group of elderly hearing-impaired subjects. An additional approach was pursued in which an acoustical index incorporating adjustments for threshold elevation was used to examine the role audibility played in the speech-recognition performance of the hearing-impaired elderly. A wide range of listening conditions was sampled in this experiment. The conclusion was that the primary determiner of speech-recognition performance in the elderly hearing-impaired subjects was their threshold elevation.},

This paper establishes a baseline with a close-to-optimal classifier, i.e., our auditory system by comparing results from 10 normal-hearing listeners to the Aurora 2 reference system using identical speech material. The baseline ASR system reaches the human performance level only when the signal-to-noise ratio is increased by 10 or 21 dB depending on the training condition. The recognition of 1-digit recordings was found to be considerably better for HSR, indicating that onset detection is an important feature neglected in standard ASR systems.

This paper presents a progress report of the joint research in the automatic vs human speech transcription and of the perceptual experiments developed at LIMSI that aims to increase our understanding of automatic speech recognition errors. Two paradigms are described here in which human listeners are asked to transcribe speech segments containing words that are frequently misrecognized by the system. In particular, we sought to gain information about the impact of increased context to help humans disambiguate problematic lexical items, typically homophone or near-homophone words. The long-term aim of this research is to improve the modeling of ambiguous contexts so as to reduce automatic transcription errors."},

	abstract = {Speech Recognition is a growing field since last five decades and there have been many advancements which has led to its applications like Speech to Text. This has allowed a possibility of Transcription of audio files to text and much of work is available on this in English, Arabic and Cantonese Languages.  
 
However, Urdu is a low-resource language in field of ASR although it is the world's \$11{\textasciicircum}\{th\}\$ most widely spoken language, with 232 Million speakers worldwide. There are no applicable models available which can be readily deployed for Speech To Text in a noisy scenario which is why Urdu Community is devoid of all the benefits of ASR. 
 
Apart from noise problems in normal telephonic or call-center conversations in Urdu, people tend to spontaneously use words from other language since Pakistan is a multi-cultural society, which presents a code-switching problem. 
 
Hence, we proposed an implementation of Automatic Speech Recognition/ Speech to Text System in a noisy/ call center environment with less labelled training data available using Hybrid HMM-DNN in a Resource constraint environment in terms of time, budget, computation power, HR etc.
 
We were able to access to call center audio files, thanks to CPLC {\textbackslash}cite\{cplc\_cplc\_nodate\} (a semi-government Law Enforcement Agency), some of which was labelled manually. We further integrated various open source data-sets to include more variety in data-set. The data comprised of mix of noisy and clean audio as well as single utterances and long sentences (1-20 second audios). It was split into 6.5 hours and 3.5 hours of train and test data-set respectively. 
 
The Language Model was developed from the training data-set and for acoustic modelling we used HMM (Monophone and Triphone) based on which we trained a Neural Network based model using Chain CNN-TDNN, achieving up to 5.2{\textbackslash}\% WER with noisy and clean data-set as well as on single word to spontaneous speech data as well.

	abstract = {In recent years lattice-based cryptography has emerged as quantum secure and theoretically elegant alternative to classical cryptographic schemes (like ECC or RSA). In addition to that, lattices are a versatile tool and play an important role in the development of efficient fully or somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE/FHE) schemes. In practice, ideal lattices defined in the polynomial ring ℤp[x]/〈xnþinspace+þinspace1〉 allow the reduction of the generally very large key sizes of lattice constructions. Another advantage of ideal lattices is that polynomial multiplication is a basic operation that has, in theory, only quasi-linear time complexity of \$\{{\textbackslash}backslashmathcal O\}(n {\textbackslash}backslashlog\{n\})\$in ℤp[x]/〈xnþinspace+þinspace1〉. However, few is known about the practical performance of the FFT in this specific application domain and whether it is really an alternative. In this work we make a first step towards efficient FFT-based arithmetic for lattice-based cryptography and show that the FFT can be implemented efficiently on reconfigurable hardware. We give instantiations of recently proposed parameter sets for homomorphic and public-key encryption. In a generic setting we are able to multiply polynomials with up to 4096 coefficients and a 17-bit prime in less than 0.5 milliseconds. For a parameter set of a SHE scheme (n=1024,p=1061093377) our implementation performs 9063 polynomial multiplications per second on a mid-range Spartan-6.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the potential of pre-learning frequently occurring low-frequency vocabulary as a means to increase comprehension of television and incidental vocabulary learning through watching television. Eight television programmes, each representing different television genres, were analysed using the RANGE program to determine the 10 most frequent low-frequency word-families in each programme and the coverage that they represented. The results showed that coverage of the 10 most frequent low-frequency word-families ranged from 0.70\% to 3.91\%, coverage of the most frequent 3,000 to 3,999 word-families ranged from 0.22\% to 2.58\%, and coverage of the 4,000 to 4,999 word-families ranged from 0.35\% to 1.96\%. This result shows the relative value of pre-learning vocabulary in television programmes and provides a strong argument for pre-learning vocabulary. The findings also suggested that if learners knew the most frequent 3,000 word-families and pre-learned low-frequency vocabulary, comprehension and incidental vocabulary learning may increase.},

	abstract = {In this corpus driven study, the scripts of 143 movies consisting of 1,267,236 running words were analyzed using the RANGE program (Heatley et al. 2002) to determine the number of encounters with low frequency words. Low frequency words were operationalized as items from Nation’s (2004) 4th to 14th 1,000-word BNC lists. The results showed that in a single movie, few words were encountered 10 or more times indicating that only a small number of words may be learned through watching one movie. However, as the number of movies analyzed increased, the number of words encountered 10 or more times increased. Twenty-three percent of the word families from Nation’s (2004) 4th 1,000-word list were encountered 10 or more times in a set of 70 movies. This indicates that if learners watch movies regularly over a long period of time, there is the potential for significant incidental learning to occur},

	abstract = {The scripts of 288 television episodes were analysed to determine the extent to which vocabulary reoccurs in television programs from the same subgenres and unrelated television programs from different genres. Episodes from two programs from each of the following three subgenres of the American drama genre: medical, spy/action, and criminal forensic investigation were compared with different sets of random episodes. The results showed that although there were an equivalent number of running words in each set of episodes, the episodes from programs within the same subgenre contained fewer word families than random programs. The findings also showed that low frequency word families (4000-14,000 levels) reoccur more often in programs within the same subgenre. Together the results indicate that watching programs within the same subgenre may be an effective approach to language learning with television because it reduces the lexical demands of viewing and increases the potential for vocabulary learning. RESUMEN Los guiones de 288 episodios televisivos se analizaron para determinar el alcance de la recursividad del vocabulario en programas de televisión del mismo subgénero y en programas no relacionados de géneros diferentes. Se compararon episodios de tres subgéneros del drama americano: médico, de espías/acción y de investigación forense, con varios grupos de episodios elegidos al azar. Los resultados muestran que, aunque el número de palabras en cada grupo de episodios era equivalente, los episodios del mismo subgénero contienen menos familias de palabras que aquellos elegidos al azar. Los hallazgos mostraron que las familias de baja frecuencia (niveles de 4.000-14.000) se repiten con más frecuencia en los programas del mismo subgénero. En conjunto, los resultados indican que el visionado de programas del mismo subgénero puede ser un método efectivo para aprender el lenguaje por medio de la televisión porque reduce la demanda léxica de la proyección y aumenta el potencial de aprendizaje de vocabulario.

Spectrographic analysis of temporal and acoustic characteristics was carried out using the Praat software. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} We found that measures of speech, such as variations in the percentage of voice breaks, number of periods of voice, number of voice breaks, shimmer (amplitude perturbation quotient), and noise-to-harmonics ratio, characterise people with AD with an accuracy of 84.8\%. \textbf{\textit{Discussion:}} These measures offer a sensitive method of assessing spontaneous speech output in AD, and they discriminate well between people with AD and healthy older adults. This method of evaluation is a promising tool for AD diagnosis and prognosis, and it could be used as a dependent measure in clinical trials.},

We show that these features outperform the eGeMAPS feature set to predict the valence and arousal emotional dimensions, which means that the audio-to-text mapping learning by the ASR system contain information related to the emotional dimensions in spontaneous speech. We also examine the relationship between first layers (closer to speech) and last layers (closer to text) of the ASR and valence/arousal.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel two-pass approach to unify streaming and non-streaming end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition in a single model. Our model adopts the hybrid CTC/attention architecture, in which the conformer layers in the encoder are modified. We propose a dynamic chunk-based attention strategy to allow arbitrary right context length. At inference time, the CTC decoder generates n-best hypotheses in a streaming way. The inference latency could be easily controlled by only changing the chunk size. The CTC hypotheses are then rescored by the attention decoder to get the final result. This efficient rescoring process causes very little sentence-level latency. Our experiments on the open 170-hour AISHELL-1 dataset show that, the proposed method can unify the streaming and non-streaming model simply and efficiently. On the AISHELL-1 test set, our unified model achieves 5.60\% relative character error rate (CER) reduction in non-streaming ASR compared to a standard non-streaming transformer. The same model achieves 5.42\% CER with 640ms latency in a streaming ASR system.},

Current pre-training procedures usually focus on training the model with several simple tasks to grasp the co-occurrence of words or sentences. However, besides co-occurring information, there exists other valuable lexical, syntactic and semantic information in training corpora, such as named entities, semantic closeness and discourse relations. In order to extract the lexical, syntactic and semantic information from training corpora, we propose a continual pre-training framework named ERNIE 2.0 which incrementally builds pre-training tasks and then learn pre-trained models on these constructed tasks via continual multi-task learning. Based on this framework, we construct several tasks and train the ERNIE 2.0 model to capture lexical, syntactic and semantic aspects of information in the training data. Experimental results demonstrate that ERNIE 2.0 model outperforms BERT and XLNet on 16 tasks including English tasks on GLUE benchmarks and several similar tasks in Chinese.

            Word embeddings are a popular machine-learning method that represents each English word by a vector, such that the geometry between these vectors captures semantic relations between the corresponding words. We demonstrate that word embeddings can be used as a powerful tool to quantify historical trends and social change. As specific applications, we develop metrics based on word embeddings to characterize how gender stereotypes and attitudes toward ethnic minorities in the United States evolved during the 20th and 21st centuries starting from 1910.

            Word embeddings are a powerful machine-learning framework that represents each English word by a vector. The geometric relationship between these vectors captures meaningful semantic relationships between the corresponding words. In this paper, we develop a framework to demonstrate how the temporal dynamics of the embedding helps to quantify changes in stereotypes and attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities in the 20th and 21st centuries in the United States. We integrate word embeddings trained on 100 y of text data with the US Census to show that changes in the embedding track closely with demographic and occupation shifts over time. The embedding captures societal shifts—e.g., the women’s movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the United States—and also illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations became more closely associated with certain populations over time. Our framework for temporal analysis of word embedding opens up a fruitful intersection between machine learning and quantitative social science.},

	abstract = {The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases present in data. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. We define metrics to quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in embeddings, and develop algorithms to "debias" the embedding. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.},

              et al.
              now show that machines can learn word associations from written texts and that these associations mirror those learned by humans, as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT) (see the Perspective by Greenwald). Why does this matter? Because the IAT has predictive value in uncovering the association between concepts, such as pleasantness and flowers or unpleasantness and insects. It can also tease out attitudes and beliefs—for example, associations between female names and family or male names and career. Such biases may not be expressed explicitly, yet they can prove influential in behavior.

            Machine learning is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying machine learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.},

This paper is a first step towards this goal and systematically quantifies the bias of a Dutch SotA ASR system against gender, age, regional accents and non-native accents. Word error rates are compared, and an in-depth phoneme-level error analysis is conducted to understand where bias is occurring. We primarily focus on bias due to articulation differences in the dataset. Based on our findings, we suggest bias mitigation strategies for ASR development.},

We address transparency and fairness in spoken language systems by proposing a study about gender representation in speech resources available through the Open Speech and Language Resource platform. We show that finding gender information in open source corpora is not straightforward and that gender balance depends on other corpus characteristics (elicited/non elicited speech, low/high resource language, speech task targeted). The paper ends with recommendations about metadata and gender information for researchers in order to assure better transparency of the speech systems built using such corpora.},

	abstract = {An investigation was carried out to determine the morphologic characteristics of elastic fibers in the superficial layer of the lamina propria of aged vocal folds (EFAVFs). Excised human adult vocal folds served as the material for this study. Scanning and transmission electron microscopic observations were made. The results can be summarized as follows. First, the EFAVFs were composed of amorphous substances and microfibrils. The amorphous substances increased in amount and the microfibrils became less numerous. Second, the EFAVFs ran in various directions, were branched, and formed a complicated network. The surface of the fibers was rough, and the fibers appeared to vary in size. Some EFAVFs united to form a sheet with a rough surface. Third, the EFAVFs could not be easily digested by elastase compared with those of younger adults. We conclude that the morphologic and metabolic changes of elastic fibers in the most important vibrating portion (superficial layer of the lamina propria) of the aged vocal folds contribute partially to aging of the voice.},

Use of maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) based speaker adaptation on ageing voices improves the WER though the performance is still considerably lower compared to adult voices. Speaker adaptation however reduces the increase in WER with age during old age. IndexTerms: Ageing Voices, longitudinal study, SCOTUScor- pus, MLLR},

Our aim is to identify the amount and the origin of linguistic differences in the way older and younger users address the system. In addition, we investigate changes in the users' linguistic behaviour after exposure to the system. The results show that the two user groups differ in their speaking style as well as their vocabulary. In contrast to younger users, who adapt their speaking style to the expected limitations of the system, older users tend to use a speaking style that is closer to human-human communication in terms of sentence complexity and politeness. However, older users are far less easy to stereotype than younger users.},

A statistical cluster analysis of 447 appointment scheduling dialogs between 50 older and younger users and 9 simulated spoken dialog systems revealed two main user groups, a “social” group and a “factual” group. “Factual” users adapted quickly to the systems and interacted efficiently with them. “Social” users, on the other hand, were more likely to treat the system like a human, and did not adapt their interaction style. While almost all “social” users were older, over a third of all older users belonged in the “factual” group. Cognitive abilities and gender did not predict group membership. We conclude that spoken dialog systems should adapt to users based on observed behavior, not on age.},

Acoustic analyses, however, indic ate that certain features such as pitch extracted from a longer s pan of speech correlate clearly with the speaker age although the systems based on those features have been inferior to the be- fore mentioned approaches. In this paper, three novel systems combining short-term cepstral features and long-term features for speaker age recognition are compared to each other. A sys- tem combining GMMs using frame-based MFCCs and Support- Vector-Machines using long-term pitch performs best. The re- sults indicate that the combination of the two feature types is a promising approach, which corresponds to findings in relat ed fields like speaker recognition.

The purpose of the present study was to extend these results to speakers with laryngeal pathologies and to conduct tests using connected speech in addition to sustained vowels. Breathiness ratings were obtained from a sustained vowel and a 12-word sentence spoken by 20 pathological and 5 nonpathological talkers. Acoustic measures were made of (a) signal periodicity, (b) first harmonic amplitude, and (c) spectral tilt. For the sustained vowels, a frequency domain measure of periodicity provided the most accurate predictions of perceived breathiness, accounting for 92\% of the variance in breathiness ratings. The relative amplitude of the first harmonic and two measures of spectral tilt correlated moderately with breathiness ratings. For the sentences, both signal periodicity and spectral tilt provided accurate predictions of breathiness ratings, accounting for 70\%-85\% of the variance.},

The effects of vowel SPL also were considered. Listeners used a seven-point equal-appearing interval scale to rate a sentence spoken by each of 10 young adult females in each of four voice qualities: normal speech, mildly breathy, severely breathy, and whisper. Significant Pearson correlations to the ratings were found only for mean SPL and the relative energy in the 100–500 and 3500–4500 Hz ranges. After the effects of mean SPL were accounted for in partial correlation and multiple regression analyses, all vowel parameters were related significantly to the mean ratings. The partial correlations for vowel duration were as high as those for the three frequency ranges. Vowel duration may be as important as spectral characteristics of vowels when breathiness is judged from samples of connected discourse.},

This makes our method capable of measuring harmonics-to-noise ratios in the lag domain with an accuracy and reliability much greater than that of any of the usual frequency-domain methods. By definition, the best candidate for the acoustic pitch period of a sound can be found from the position of the maximum of the autocorrelation function of the sound, while the degree of periodicity (the harmonics-to-noise ratio) of the sound can be found from the relative height of this maximum.

This change includes not only loudness but also other acoustic features such as pitch, rate, and duration of syllables. This compensation effect maintains the auditory signal-to-noise ratio of the speaker's spoken words.
The effect links to the needs of effective communication, as there is a reduced effect when words are repeated or lists are read where communication intelligibility is not important. Since the effect is involuntary it is used as a means to detect malingering in those simulating hearing loss. Research on birds and monkeys find that the effect also occurs in the vocalizations of animals.
The effect was discovered in 1909 by Étienne Lombard, a French otolaryngologist.},

              When severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic lockdowns were instituted across entire countries, human activities ceased in an unprecedented way. Derryberry
              et al.
              found that the reduction in traffic sound in the San Francisco Bay Area of California to levels not seen for half a century led to a shift in song frequency in white-crowned sparrows (see the Perspective by Halfwerk). This shift was especially notable because the frequency of human-produced traffic noise occurs within a range that interferes with the highest performance and most effective song. Thus, our “quiet” allowed the birds to quickly fill the most effective song space.

            Actions taken to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have conspicuously reduced motor vehicle traffic, potentially alleviating auditory pressures on animals that rely on sound for survival and reproduction. Here, by comparing soundscapes and songs across the San Francisco Bay Area before and during the recent statewide shutdown, we evaluated whether a common songbird responsively exploited newly emptied acoustic space. We show that noise levels in urban areas were substantially lower during the shutdown, characteristic of traffic in the mid-1950s. We also show that birds responded by producing higher performance songs at lower amplitudes, effectively maximizing communication distance and salience. These findings illustrate that behavioral traits can change rapidly in response to newly favorable conditions, indicating an inherent resilience to long-standing anthropogenic pressures such as noise pollution.},

	abstract = {Vocal amplitude, one of the crucial factors for the exchange of acoustic signals, has been neglected in studies of animal communication, but recent studies on song variation in Common Nightingales Luscinia megarhynchos have revealed new insights into its importance in the singing behavior of territorial birds. In nightingales song amplitude is not maximized per se, but is individually regulated according to the level of masking background noise. Also, birds adjust their vocal intensity according to social variables, as in male-male interactions. Moreover, during such interactions, males exploited the directionality of their songs to broadcast them in the direction of the intended receivers ensuring the most effective signal transmission. Studies of the development of this typical long-range signaling suggest that sound level is highly interrelated with overall developmental progression and learning, and thus should be viewed as an integral part of song ontogeny. I conclude that song amplitude is a dynamic feature of the avian signal system, which is individually regulated according to the ecological demands of signal transmission and the social context of communication.
          , 
            A amplitude vocal, um dos fatores cruciais para a troca de sinais acústicos, tem sido negligenciada nos estudos da comunicação animal, mas trabalhos recentes sobre a variação do canto do Rouxinol-comum Luscinia megarhynchos evidenciaram sua importância no comportamento de canto das aves territoriais. No rouxinol a amplitude do canto não é aumentada ao máximo per se, mas é regulada individualmente de acordo com o nível de ruído de fundo que mascara o sinal. As aves também ajustam sua intensidade vocal às variáveis sociais, tais como nas interações entre machos. Além disso, durante essas interações, os machos tiram proveito da direcionalidade de seus cantos para emiti-los em direção aos receptores desejados no intuito de garantir a mais eficiente transmissão do sinal. Estudos do desenvolvimento desta sinalização típica de longo alcance sugerem que o nível sonoro seja altamente relacionado com o desenvolvimento geral e a aprendizagem, e deveria portanto ser visto como parte integrante da ontogenia do canto. Concluímos que a amplitude do canto é um parâmetro dinâmico do sistema de sinalização em aves, que é regulado individualmente de acordo com as exigências ecológicas da transmissão do sinal e o contexto social da comunicação.},

                The
                Lombard effect
                describes the tendency for speakers to increase pitch, intensity, and duration in the presence of noise. It is unclear whether these modifications are uniformly applied across all words within an utterance or whether information-bearing content words are further enhanced compared with function words. In the present study, the authors investigated the influence of linguistic content on acoustic modifications made to speech in noise.
              
            
            
              Method
              
                Sixteen speaker–listener pairs engaged in an interactive cooperative game in quiet, 60 dB of multitalker noise, and 90 dB of multitalker noise. Speaker productions were analyzed to examine differences in fundamental frequency (F
                0
                ), intensity, and duration of target words in sentences across noise conditions.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Proportional increases in F
                0,
                intensity, and duration were noted for all word types as noise increased from quiet to 60 dB. From quiet to 90 dB, content words that referred to agents, objects, and locations were disproportionately elongated compared with function words. Additionally, agents were further enhanced by increased F
                0
                .
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                At moderate noise levels, most word types appear to be uniformly boosted in F
                0
                , intensity, and duration. As noise increases, linguistic content shapes the extent of the Lombard effect, with F
                0
                and duration serving as primary cues for marking information-bearing word types.},

	abstract = {Respiratory measurements were made using linearized magnetometers placed antero-posteriorly over the rib cages and abdomens of five healthy young women. Background noise was introduced over headphones simultaneously as "babble" presented binaurally at 55 dB ("moderate noise") and 70 dB ("high noise"). Speech during oral reading and spontaneous monologue was transduced with a microphone positioned near the lips, from which a speaking intensity signal (dBA) was derived. Subjects were instructed to speak during the noise conditions, but no instruction was given to alter speaking intensity. Compared with a "no noise" condition, the speaking intensities of all the subjects increased significantly for both speech tasks in the moderate and high noise conditions, thereby replicating the well-documented Lombard effect. No consistent trend of lung volume change was observed, in contrast to the linear increases in speech intensity as the noise level increased. For the higher speech intensities during the moderate and high noise conditions both initiation and termination lung volumes either increased or decreased. These preliminary findings suggest that when speech intensity is increased following the introduction of noise via headphones rather than by specific instructions to speak more loudly, speakers employ variable lung volume strategies for intensity control.},

            The current project aimed to investigate the potentially different linguistic correlates of comprehensibility (i.e., ease of understanding) and accentedness (i.e., linguistic nativelikeness) in adult second language (L2) learners’ extemporaneous speech production. Timed picture descriptions from 120 beginner, intermediate, and advanced Japanese learners of English were analyzed using native speaker global judgments based on learners’ comprehensibility and accentedness, and then submitted to segmental, prosodic, temporal, lexical, and grammatical analyses. Results showed that comprehensibility was related to all linguistic domains, and accentedness was strongly tied with pronunciation (specifically segmentals) rather than lexical and grammatical domains. In particular, linguistic correlates of L2 comprehensibility and accentedness were found to vary by learners’ proficiency levels. In terms of comprehensibility, optimal rate of speech, appropriate and rich vocabulary use, and adequate and varied prosody were important for beginner to intermediate levels, whereas segmental accuracy, good prosody, and correct grammar featured strongly for intermediate to advanced levels. For accentedness, grammatical complexity was a feature of intermediate to high-level performance, whereas segmental and prosodic variables were essential to accentedness across all levels. These findings suggest that syllabi tailored to learners’ proficiency level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced) and learning goal (comprehensibility or nativelike accent) would be advantageous for the teaching of L2 speaking.},

	abstract = {Speech coding affects speech recognition performance, with recognition accuracy deteriorating as the coded bit rate decreases. Virtually all systems that recognize coded speech reconstruct the speech waveform from the coded parameters, and then perform recognition (after possible noise and/or channel compensation) using conventional techniques. In this paper we compare the recognition accuracy of coded speech obtained by reconstructing the speech waveform with the speech recognition accuracy obtained when using cepstral features derived from the coding parameters. We focus our efforts on speech that has been coded using the 13-kbps full-rate GSM codec, a Regular Pulse Excited Long Term Prediction (RPE-LTP) codec. The GSM codec develops separate representations for the linear prediction (LPC) filter and the residual signal components of the coded speech. We measure the effects of quantization and coding on the accuracy with which these parameters are represented, and present two differe...},

	abstract = {In this paper, various methodologies of acoustic and language models, as well as labeling methods for automatic speech recognition for spoken dialogues in emergency call centers were investigated and comparatively analyzed. Because of the fact that dialogue speech in call centers has specific context and noisy, emotional environments, available speech recognition systems show poor performance. Therefore, in order to accurately recognize dialogue speeches, the main modules of speech recognition systems—language models and acoustic training methodologies—as well as symmetric data labeling approaches have been investigated and analyzed. To find an effective acoustic model for dialogue data, different types of Gaussian Mixture Model/Hidden Markov Model (GMM/HMM) and Deep Neural Network/Hidden Markov Model (DNN/HMM) methodologies were trained and compared. Additionally, effective language models for dialogue systems were defined based on extrinsic and intrinsic methods. Lastly, our suggested data labeling approaches with spelling correction are compared with common labeling methods resulting in outperforming the other methods with a notable percentage. Based on the results of the experiments, we determined that DNN/HMM for an acoustic model, trigram with Kneser–Ney discounting for a language model and using spelling correction before training data for a labeling method are effective configurations for dialogue speech recognition in emergency call centers. It should be noted that this research was conducted with two different types of datasets collected from emergency calls: the Dialogue dataset (27 h), which encapsulates call agents’ speech, and the Summary dataset (53 h), which contains voiced summaries of those dialogues describing emergency cases. Even though the speech taken from the emergency call center is in the Azerbaijani language, which belongs to the Turkic group of languages, our approaches are not tightly connected to specific language features. Hence, it is anticipated that suggested approaches can be applied to the other languages of the same group.},

In such data all events of a caller passing through the routing are stored. Consequently, it is possible to trace more precisely what the customer experiences during his call. However, this information is only available in semi-structured form. A little-known approach in Anglo-Saxon literature, the Visual Business Analytics (VBA), represents a holistic concept for achieving added value from semi-structured data. In the VBA, data is initially transformed and structured and then prepared for analysis purposes. The goal is to derive recommendations for supporting management decisions in a call center. In the further course, the development of the approaches of information representation is examined first, then the VBA is presented and applied to the log protocols in a call center. Finally, other call center applications of VBA are considered, and an outlook is given on other industries in which the use of VBA offers advantages.},

It was determined that 120 of the scanned articles were written by the Social Sciences Institute, 28 were written by Marmara University, and 180 were postgraduate theses. When the subjects of the examined studies were classi-fied in terms of call center components, it was observed that 114 postgraduate theses were related to the human factor. In addition, it was found that strategy, process and technology-related subjects were among the research topics in the call center components. As a result, other disciplines as well as social sciences should show interest equally in the subject of call center, which should be addressed by many disciplines, in terms of contributing to the development of call centers. It is thought that it is possible to improve the system by focusing on the studies that examine the "strategy" and "technology" factor, as well as the employee and customer-oriented studies investigating the "human" factor from the call center components.},

This paper argues that although this critique of working conditions is well-intended, it has led to unwanted stigmatization of not just call center work but also of call center agents. Much has been published on call centers, but the stigma this work entails and the effect this has on agents on and off the phone has been overlooked. This paper applies Goffman’s notion of stigma to data collected through long-term ethnography and interviews with over seventy call center agents in a London call center. I show how agents experience, manage, and resist stigma. The analysis reveals that agents attempt to hide where they work by adopting different accents and avoiding specific lexis associated with call center language. I conclude by suggesting potential avenues for reducing the stigma of working in a call center, e.g. shifting the dominant discussion in academia beyond debates surrounding standardization.},

            Every individual has some unique speaking style and this variation influences their speech characteristics. Speakers’ native dialect is one of the major factors influencing their speech characteristics that influence the performance of automatic speech recognition system (ASR). In this paper, we describe a method to identify Hindi dialects and examine the contribution of different acoustic-phonetic features for the purpose. Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), Perceptual linear prediction coefficients (PLP) and PLP derived from Mel-scale filter bank (MF- PLP) have been extracted as spectral features from the spoken utterances. They are further used to measure the capability of Auto-associative neural networks (AANN) for capturing non-linear relation specific to information from spectral features. Prosodic features are for capturing long - range features. Based on these features efficiency of AANN is measured to model intrinsic characteristics of speech features due to dialects.},

	abstract = {Collecting and accessing a large amount of medical data is very time-consuming and laborious, not only because it is difficult to find specific patients but also because it is required to resolve the confidentiality of a patient's medical records. On the other hand, there are deep learning models, trained on easily collectible, large scale datasets such as Youtube or Wikipedia, offering useful representations. It could therefore be very advantageous to utilize the features from these pre-trained networks for handling a small amount of data at hand. In this work, we exploit various multi-modal features extracted from pre-trained networks to recognize Alzheimer's Dementia using a neural network, with a small dataset provided by the ADReSS Challenge at INTERSPEECH 2020. The challenge regards to discern patients suspicious of Alzheimer's Dementia by providing acoustic and textual data. With the multi-modal features, we modify a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network based structure to perform classification and regression tasks simultaneously and is capable of computing conversations with variable lengths. Our test results surpass baseline's accuracy by 18.75\%, and our validation result for the regression task shows the possibility of classifying 4 classes of cognitive impairment with an accuracy of 78.70\%.},

Our classification framework takes advantage of both acoustic and textual feature embeddings, which are extracted independently and later combined. Speech signals are encoded into acoustic features using DNN speaker embeddings extracted from pre-trained models. For textual input, contextual embedding vectors are first extracted using an English Bert model and then used either to directly compute sentence embeddings or to feed a bidirectional LSTM-RNNs with attention. Finally, an SVM classifier with linear kernel is used for the individual evaluation of the three systems. Our best system, based on the combination of linguistic and acoustic information, attained a classification accuracy of 81.25\%. Results have shown the importance of linguistic features in the classification of Alzheimer's Disease, which outperforms the acoustic ones in terms of accuracy. Early stage features fusion did not provide additional improvements, confirming that the discriminant ability conveyed by speech in this case is smooth out by linguistic data.},

	volume = {9},
	abstract = {This paper describes and proposes an efficient and effective framework for the design and development of a speaker-independent continuous automatic Arabic speech recognition system based on a phonetically rich and balanced speech corpus. The speech corpus contains a total of 415 sentences recorded by 40 (20 male and 20 female) Arabic native speakers from 11 different Arab countries representing the three major regions (Levant, Gulf, and Africa) in the Arab world. The proposed Arabic speech recognition system is based on the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Sphinx tools, and the Cambridge HTK tools were also used at some testing stages. The speech engine uses 3-emitting state Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for tri-phone based acoustic models. Based on experimental analysis of about 7 hours of training speech data, the acoustic model is best using continuous observation's probability model of 16 Gaussian mixture distributions and the state distributions were tied to 500 senones. The language model contains both bi-grams and tri-grams. For similar speakers but different sentences, the system obtained a word recognition accuracy of 92.67\% and 93.88\% and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 11.27\% and 10.07\% with and without diacritical marks respectively. For different speakers with similar sentences, the system obtained a word recognition accuracy of 95.92\% and 96.29\% and a WER of 5.78\% and 5.45\% with and without diacritical marks respectively. Whereas different speakers and different sentences, the system obtained a word recognition accuracy of 89.08\% and 90.23\% and a WER of 15.59\% and 14.44\% with and without diacritical marks respectively.},

	abstract = {Taking devantage of the property that Korean digit is a mono-syllable word, we proposed a spoken Korean-digit recognition scheme using the multi-layer perceptron. The spoken Korean-digit is divided into three segments (initial sound, medial vowel, and final consonant) based on the voice starting / ending points and a peak point in the middle of vowel sound. The feature vectors such as cepstrum, reflection coefficients, cepstrum and energy are extracted from each segment. It has been shown that cepstrum, as an input vector to the neural network, gives higher recognition rate than reflection coefficients. Regression coefficients of cepstrum did not affect as much as we expected on the recognition rate. That is because, it is believed, we extracted features from the selected stationary segments of the input speech signal. With 150 ceptral coefficients obtained from each spoken digit, we achieved correct recognition rate of 97.8\%.},

	abstract = {A model for deriving perceived local speech rate directly out of the speech signal is developed based on perception experiments. Since local speech rate modifies acoustic cues (e.g. transitions and voice-onset time [5]), phones [1, 4, 7, 19], syllables [3, 15], and even words, it is one of the most important prosodic cues. Our local speech rate estimation method is based on a linear combination of the local syllable rate and the local phone rate, since earlier investigations [11, 12] strongly suggest that neither the syllable rate nor the phone rate on its own represent the speech rate sufficiently. In the literature [6] effects of F0 level and F0 movement on speech rate perception have been reported. Therefore we included these cues in our linear combination model. Our results show 1) that the duration of speech stimuli has a strong influence on the perception of speech rate, 2) that the linear combination of local syllable rate and phone rate is wellcorrelated with perceptual local...},

A fundamental frequency analysis program (SEARP) was used to measure mean fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, and phonation range from samples of connected speech and sustained vowel production. Subjects in good physical condition produced maximum duration vowel phonation with significantly less jitter and shimmer and had larger phonation ranges than did subjects of similar chronological ages who were in poor physical condition. These differences were most apparent in the production of the elderly subjects. While chronological aging is undoubtedly a contributor to such changes in the acoustic characteristics of voice, these results suggest that age-related changes in body physiology, or physiological aging, also must be considered.},

Our methods are acoustic analyses and perception tests. The perception tests are designed to analyse the influence of the vowel onset on the amount of information about aging transferred by sustained vowels. The acoustic evaluation comprises phonic parameters like measurements of stability of voice or of vocal tremor which are supposed to reflect voice qualities that are expected to vary with age. Changes in tempo of articulation are also investigated. We found that increasing amplitude perturbation is an indicator of increasing age even on the basis of spontaneous speech. Reading rate decreases with increasing age, whereas there is no significant change in articulation rate of spontaneous speech in women's voices. Based on sustained vowels of female voices, the frequency tremor intensity index indicates age more accurately than F0 and amplitude perturbations.

	title = {Corpus-based spoken language understanding for mixed initiative spoken dialog systems},
	abstract = {Spoken dialogues systems are interfaces between users and services. Simple examples of services for which theses dialogue systems can be used include : banking, booking (hotels, trains, flights), etc. Dialogue systems are composed of a number of modules. The main modules include Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), Dialogue Management and Speech Generation. In this thesis, we concentrate on the Spoken Language Understanding component of dialogue systems. In the past, it has usual to separate the Spoken Language Understanding process from that of Automatic Speech Recognition. First, the Automatic Speech Recognition process finds the best word hypothesis. Given this hypothesis, we then find the best semantic interpretation. This thesis presents a method for the robust extraction of basic conceptual constituents (or concepts) from an audio message. The conceptual decoding model proposed follows a stochastic paradigm and is directly integrated into the Automatic Speech Recognition process. This approach allows us to keep the probabilistic search space on sequences of words produced by the Automatic Speech Recognition module, and to project it to a probabilistic search space of sequences of concepts. The experiments carried out on the French spoken dialogue corpus MEDIA, available through ELDA, show that the performance reached by our new approach is better than the traditional sequential approach. As a starting point for evaluation, the effect that deterioration of word error rate (WER) has on SLU systems is examined though use of different ASR outputs. The SLU performance appears to decrease lineary as a function of ASR word error rate.We show, however, that the proposed integrated method of searching for both words and concets, gives better results to that of a traditionnanl sequential approach. In order to validate our approach, we conduct experiments on the MEDIA corpus in the same assessment conditions used during the MEDIA campaign. The goal is toproduce error-free semantic interpretations from transcripts. The results show that the performance achieved by our model is as good as the systems involved in the evaluation campaign. Studies made on the MEDIA corpus show the concept error rate is related to the word error rate, the size of the training corpus and a priori knwoledge added to conceptual model languages. Error analyses show the interest of modifying the probabilities of word lattice with triggers, a template cache or by using arbitrary rules requiring passage through a portion of the graph and applying the presence of triggers (words or concepts) based on history. Methods based on machine learning are generally quite demanding in terms of amount of training data required. By changing the size of the training corpus, the minimum and the optimal number of dialogues needed for training conceptual language models can be measured. Research conducted in this thesis aims to determine the size of corpus necessary for training conceptual language models from which the semantic evaluation scores stagnated. A correlation is established between the necessary corpus size for learning and the corpus size necessary to validate the manual annotations. In the case of the MEDIA evaluation campaign, it took roughly the same number of examples, first to validate the semantic annotations and, secondly, to obtain a "quality" corpus-trained stochastic model. The addition of a priori knowledge to our stochastic models reduce significantly the size of the training corpus needed to achieve the same scores as a fully stochastic system (nearly half the size for the same score). It allows us to confirm that the addition of basic intuitive rules (numbers, zip codes, dates) gives very encouraging results. It leeds us to create a hybrid system combining corpus-based and knowledge-based models. The second part of the thesis examines the application of the understanding module to another simple dialogue system task, a callrouting system. A problem with this specific task is a lack of data available for training the requiered language models. We attempt to resolve this issue by supplementing he in-domain data with various other generic corpora already available, and data from the MEDIA campaing. We show the benefits of integrating a call classification task in a SLU process. Unfortunately, we have very little training corpus in the field under consideration. By using our integrated approach to decode concepts, along with an integrated process, we propose a bag of words and concepts approach. This approach used by a classifier achieved encouraging call classification rates on the test corpus, while the WER was relativelyhigh. The methods developed are shown to improve the call routing system process robustness.},

An intention recognition algorithm is designed for the classification results. Each datum has a corresponding intention label to complete the task of semantic slot filling. The attention mechanism is applied to the recognition of rare slot value information, the weight of hidden state and corresponding slot characteristics are obtained, and the updated slot value is used to represent the tracking state. An auxiliary gate unit is constructed between the upper and lower slots of historical dialogue, and the word vector is trained based on deep learning to complete the task of spoken language understanding. The simulation results show that the proposed method can realize multiple rounds of man-machine spoken language.

To improve the results various subword units -called as morphs -are applied as basic language elements.

In this paper we make an attempt to explore the source of this variability. Different LVCSR tasks of an agglutinative language are investigated in numerous experiments using full vocabularies. The improvement results are compared to pre-existing other language results, as well. Important correlations are found between the morph-based improvements and between the vocabulary growths and the corpus sizes.},

The most obvious examples are background noise, peculiarities of the speaker's voice, sloppy articulation and strong emotional load. These all pose difficult problems for robust speech recognition, but it is not exactly clear how much each contributes to the difficulty of the task. In this paper we examine the abilities of our best recognition technologies under near-ideal conditions. The optimal conditions will be simulated by working with the sound material of an audiobook, in which most of the disturbing factors mentioned above are absent. Firstly pure phone recognition experiments will be performed, where neural net-based technologies will also be tried as well as the conventional Hidden Markov Models. Then we move on to large vocabulary recognition, where morphbased language models are applied to improve the performance of the standard word-based technology. The tests clearly justify our assertion that audiobooks pose a much easier recognition task than real-life databases. In both types of tasks we report the lowest error rates we have achieved so far in Hungarian continuous speech recognition.},

Since such speech recognition systems are applied mostly for information retrieval purposes we use evaluation metrics accordingly. Standard 3-gram language model with one million words vocabulary is used for words whereas statistical morph-based models are applied with smaller vocabularies and with higher order of n-gram models. Fostering real life applicability, the computational time and memory usage of the various approaches is kept below real-time and 1.5 GB, respectively. The lexical modeling approaches are tested on Hungarian Broadcast News and Broadcast Conversation speech. In our setup, although word-based models outperformed morph-based ones in terms of both word error rate and spoken term detection measures, a search-cascade of the word and morph approaches improved the latter results significantly.},

However, there are still techno-logical barriers to flexible solutions and user satisfaction under some circumstances. This is related to several factors, such as the sensitivity to the environment (background noise or chan-nel variability), or the weak representation of grammatical and semantic knowledge. Current research is also emphasizing deficiencies in deal-ing with variation naturally present in speech. For instance, the lack of robustness to foreign accents precludes the use by spe-cific populations. There are actually many factors affecting the speech realization: regional, sociolinguistic, or related to the environment or the speaker itself. These create a wide range of variations that may not be modeled correctly (speaker, gen-der, speech rate, vocal effort, regional accents, speaking style, non stationarity...), especially when resources for system train-ing are scarce.

            Speech recognition of a language is a key area in the field of pattern recognition. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the speech recognition techniques for non-Indian and Indian languages, and compiled some of the computational models used for processing speech acoustics. An immense number of frameworks are available for speech processing and recognition for languages persisting around the globe. However, a limited number of automatic speech recognition systems are available for commercial use. The gap between the languages being spoken around the globe and the technical support available to these languages are very few. This paper examined major challenges for speech recognition for different languages. Analysis of the literature shows that lack of standard databases availability of minority languages hinder the research recognition research across the globe. When compared with non-Indian languages, the research on speech recognition of Indian languages (except Hindi) has not achieved the expected milestone yet. Combination of MFCC and DNN–HMM classifier is most commonly used system for developing ASR minority languages, whereas in some of the majority languages, researchers are using much advance algorithms of DNN. It has also been observed that the research in this field is quite thin and still more research needs to be carried out, particularly in the case of minority languages.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of speech recognition systems degrades when operated in adverse acoustical environments. This paper reviews various methods by which more detailed mathematical descriptions of the effects of environmental degradation can improve speech recognition accuracy using both "data-driven" and "model-based" compensation strategies. Data-driven meth- ods learn environmental characteristics through direct compari- sons of speech recorded in the noisy environment with the same speech recorded under optimal conditions. Model-based methods use a mathematical model of the environment and attempt to use samples of the degraded speech to estimate model parameters. These general approaches to environmental compensation are discussed in terms of recent research in envi- ronmental robustness at CMU, and in terms of similar efforts at other sites. These compensation algorithms are evaluated in a series of experiments measuring recognition accuracy for speech from the ARPA Wall Street Journal database that is cor- rupted by artificially-added noise at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and in more natural speech recognition tasks.},
