    \label{cha:declaration}
    I, \textit{Muhammad Danyal Khan} declare that this thesis titled ``Automatic Speech and Sentiment Recognition to identify malicious activity/mal-intended speech'' and the work presented in it are my own and has been generated by me as a result of my own original research. \\

    I confirm that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item This work was done wholly or mainly while in candidature for a Master of Science degree at NUST
        \item Where any part of this thesis has previously been submitted for a degree or any other qualification at NUST or any other institution, this has been clearly stated
        \item Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed
        \item Where I have quoted from the work of others, the source is always given. With the exception of such quotations, this thesis is entirely my own work
        \item I have acknowledged all main sources of help
        \item Where the thesis is based on work done by myself jointly with others, I have made clear exactly what was done by others and what I have contributed myself
    \end{enumerate}
